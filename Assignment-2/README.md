# ðŸŒ± NDVI Land Cover Classification - Summer Analytics 2025

This repository contains my submission for the **First Course Hackathon** hosted by **Consulting & Analytics Club** and **GeeksforGeeks** as part of **Summer Analytics 2025**.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Use NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series data to classify land cover types into categories such as:
- Water
- Impervious
- Farm
- Forest
- Grass
- Orchard

Model used: **Multiclass Logistic Regression** (only model allowed)

## ðŸ§  Approach

- **Missing Value Handling**: Mean imputation of NDVI values
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted `mean`, `std`, `min`, `max`, and `range` from 27 NDVI time-series columns
- **Scaling**: Standardized features using `StandardScaler`
- **Model**: Trained a Logistic Regression model (`saga` solver, multinomial class)
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~92.06%
- **Prediction**: Used model to classify the test set
