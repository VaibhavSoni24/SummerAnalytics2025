# 🚗 Data Grand Prix – Cars Data Analysis
**Assignment 1 – Summer Analytics 2025 by IIT Guwahati**

Welcome to my submission for the first assignment of the Summer Analytics 2025 course, organized by IIT Guwahati!  
This project dives into a dataset of cars, exploring various features such as mileage (mpg), horsepower, weight, acceleration, and more – with the aim to uncover patterns and generate insights using Python and its popular data libraries.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- `Cars.csv`  
The dataset contains technical specifications of 398 cars, including:
- `mpg` (miles per gallon)
- `horsepower`
- `weight`
- `acceleration`
- `origin`
- `model_year`, etc.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Topics Covered
- Reading and cleaning data
- Index manipulation
- Filtering with conditions
- Aggregations and groupby operations
- Handling missing values
- Statistical queries (mean, std deviation, unique values)
- Data visualizations (line plots, scatter plots, hue/size mapping)
- Identifying patterns like consistent models, fuel efficiency trends, and more

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- 📉 Multi-line plot of MPG over the years by origin
- 🔘 Scatterplot of Horsepower vs Weight (color by origin, size by mpg)
- 📊 Summary stats for consistent car models (low mpg variation)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaibhavSoni24/DataGrandPrix-CarsAnalysis.git
   ```
2. Open `assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Ensure `Cars.csv` is in the same directory
4. Run the notebook cells in order
